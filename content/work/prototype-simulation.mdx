# Prototype: Large-Scale Battle Simulation

This prototype demonstrates our simulation capabilities by rendering and simulating large-scale battles in real-time.

## Challenge

The goal was to create a system that could simulate and render 50,000+ units simultaneously while maintaining 60 FPS. Traditional approaches would struggle with this scale.

## Solution

We developed a custom ECS architecture optimized for this use case:

1. **Spatial partitioning** for efficient collision detection
2. **LOD system** for rendering distant units
3. **GPU-accelerated** pathfinding and behavior updates

## Technical Highlights

- **Entity Component System** for efficient data layout
- **Hierarchical spatial grid** for broad-phase culling
- **Instanced rendering** for unit visualization
- **Multi-threaded** simulation updates

## Results

The prototype successfully demonstrates:

- **50,000+ units** simulated and rendered at 60 FPS
- **Scalable architecture** that can handle even larger counts
- **Clean separation** between simulation and rendering

## Future Work

We're exploring distributed simulation architectures to scale to even larger scenarios, potentially handling millions of entities across multiple machines.
