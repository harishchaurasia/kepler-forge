# Spatial Computing and XR Development

Building compelling XR experiences requires solving unique challenges around spatial tracking, hand interaction, and performance optimization.

## Spatial Tracking

Accurate spatial tracking is fundamental to immersive XR. We've developed a hybrid tracking system that combines:

- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** for environment understanding
- **Hand tracking** using computer vision
- **Eye tracking** for foveated rendering

## Interaction Patterns

XR interaction requires rethinking traditional input paradigms:

- **Direct manipulation** via hand tracking
- **Gaze-based selection** for hands-free interaction
- **Spatial UI** that exists in 3D space

## Performance Considerations

XR has strict performance requirements:

- **90 FPS minimum** for VR (120 FPS for some headsets)
- **Low latency** to prevent motion sickness
- **Foveated rendering** to reduce pixel processing

XR development requires careful attention to user comfort. Always test with real users to ensure experiences don't cause motion sickness.

## Platform Support

Our XR framework supports:

- **Meta Quest** series
- **Apple Vision Pro**
- **WebXR** for browser-based experiences
