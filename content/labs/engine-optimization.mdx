# Real-Time Rendering Optimizations

Achieving consistent frame rates requires careful attention to every stage of the rendering pipeline. This post covers the optimization techniques we've implemented in our engine.

## GPU-Driven Rendering

Modern GPUs are powerful enough to handle much of the rendering logic themselves. We've moved to a GPU-driven pipeline that reduces CPU overhead:

- **Indirect drawing** for batching
- **Frustum culling on GPU** using compute shaders
- **Occlusion queries** for visibility determination

## Memory Management

Efficient memory usage is critical for performance:

- **Texture streaming** for large assets
- **Geometry instancing** for repeated meshes
- **Buffer pooling** to reduce allocation overhead

## Profiling and Debugging

We've built custom profiling tools that integrate with our engine:

- Real-time GPU timing via timestamp queries
- CPU profiler with flame graphs
- Memory allocation tracking

These optimizations resulted in a 40% performance improvement in our benchmark scenes.

## Results

Our optimized rendering pipeline now handles:

- **Complex scenes** with 100K+ draw calls
- **Dynamic lighting** with hundreds of lights
- **Post-processing** effects without frame drops
